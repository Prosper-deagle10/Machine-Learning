# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques, leveraging the Boston House Price Dataset. The problem is a regression task since the target variable, median house price (MEDV), is a continuous value.

Dataset Information
Source: The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Size: 506 rows and 14 columns.
Features:
Input Features (13): CRIM, ZN, INDUS, CHAS, NOX, RM, AGE, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT.
Target Variable (1): MEDV (Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s).
Key Attributes:
Positive relationships (e.g., RM positively correlates with MEDV).
Negative relationships (e.g., LSTAT negatively correlates with MEDV).
Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Checked for missing values (house_price_dataset.isnull().sum()).
No missing values detected in the dataset, ensuring its readiness for analysis.
Data Analysis:

Conducted a correlation analysis with a heatmap to understand the relationships among features.
Key observations:
RM (average number of rooms) has a strong positive correlation with MEDV.
LSTAT (% lower status population) shows a strong negative correlation with MEDV.
Data Splitting:

Input features (X) and target variable (Y) separated.
Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets using train_test_split.
Model Training:

Used XGBoost Regressor as the machine learning model.
The model was trained using the training dataset (X_train, Y_train).
Model Evaluation:

Predictions were made on both training and testing datasets.
Metrics used:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Observations from predictions:
High accuracy on the training data, indicating the model effectively learns the patterns.
Results on test data indicate the model's potential generalization performance.
Results
Evaluation Metrics:
Metric	Training Data	Test Data
MAE	Low	Slightly Higher
MSE	Low	Slightly Higher
RMSE	Low	Slightly Higher
Predictions:
The model performed well on both training and testing datasets.
Some overfitting may be present due to differences in errors between training and test data.
Key Factors Influencing House Prices:
RM (Average Rooms): Positively correlated with house prices. Larger houses tend to cost more.
LSTAT (% Lower Status Population): Negatively correlated with house prices. Areas with a higher proportion of lower-status populations tend to have lower house prices.
Conclusion
The XGBoost Regressor proved to be an effective algorithm for predicting Boston house prices, offering reliable predictions based on input features. The model can be further fine-tuned to reduce overfitting and improve its generalization performance.
